### Employee - Salary Info

- This React project was created to allow users to enter and save employee names and salary information.
- For styling, I used Tailwind CSS.
- To manage the state, I used useState, and passed data using props.
- Additionally, implemented a modal structure for displaying errors in input forms.
- Used createPortal function for displaying error that allows me to render children.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
